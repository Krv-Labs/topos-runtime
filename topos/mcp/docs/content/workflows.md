# Topos Agent Workflows

This is the expanded guide for using Topos tools in a closed-loop refactor.
Agents should read `topos://docs/agent-contract` first and use this document
only when they need detail beyond the compact outcome contract.

**Call shape.** Every tool takes a flat arguments object — named inputs at the
top level, e.g. `{"filepath": "..."}`. There is no `params` wrapper; sending
one is rejected as an unknown field.

## Tool index

All 18 registered tools. The loop below uses the first group; the rest are
situational.

| Tool | Use |
| --- | --- |
| `topos_evaluate_file` | Score a file on disk. `refactor_targets=N` adds ranked edit spans. |
| `topos_evaluate_project` | Rollup + worst-N files for a directory. |
| `topos_evaluate_code` | Score a source string (SIMPLE/SECURE/NAVIGABLE — no file, so no coupling). |
| `topos_inspect_code` | Per-function complexity, entropy detail, full metric table. With `filepath` it resolves the dependency graph exactly as `topos_evaluate_file` does (`gitnexus_dir` / `no_composable`), so the two agree on the same file — including when COMPOSABLE is unavailable and `warnings` says why. With a `code` string, SIMPLE/SECURE/NAVIGABLE only. |
| `topos_assess_worktree_change` | Verify an in-place edit against a git ref. **Default verification.** |
| `topos_begin_refactor` → `topos_assess_snapshot` | Verify when the baseline is untracked/uncommitted. |
| `topos_assess_improvement` | Verify a side-by-side proposed variant. |
| `topos_assess_changeset` | Verify several edited files at once against a git ref. |
| `topos_compare_files` / `topos_compare_code` | AST edit distance between two versions (no verdict). |
| `topos_preference_walk` | Resolve `target` / `fallback_target` / `next_step` for a ranking, standalone. |
| `topos_depgraph_status` | Read-only GitNexus diagnosis; never triggers generation. |
| `topos_generate_depgraph` | Force a GitNexus rebuild/refresh. |
| `topos_refactor` | Advisory hotspots. Never affects the medal. |
| `topos_calculate_coverage` | Structural test coverage. Outside the lattice. |
| `topos_get_doc` | Fetch one of the seven embedded topics. |
| `topos_compiled_plan` | Probe clang and emit a compiled-optimization plan. Builds nothing. |
| `topos_compiled_apply` | Measure an approved plan; promote only if SPEED and SIZE both pass. |
| `topos_compiled_rollback` | Restore the pre-apply baseline binary. |

## Which server am I talking to?

Read the `topos://build` resource. It reports the running binary's version and
build time, its executable path, the resolved file root, the pid, and whether
the binary on disk has been **rebuilt since this process started**.

That last field matters: an MCP host owns the server process, so rebuilding
Topos does not replace a running server — tool calls keep reaching the old
code until it is restarted. When that happens, every tool response is prefixed
with a stale-server warning; healthy responses carry nothing. If results
contradict the source you are reading, check here before re-measuring.

Outside MCP, `topos-mcp --version` prints the same report.

## The canonical loop: review → plan → refactor → re-measure

### 1. Measure

- Single file: `topos_evaluate_file` with
  `{"filepath": "..."}` — by default this also detects and
  generates/refreshes `.gitnexus` (missing or stale → runs `gitnexus
  analyze`) before scoring, so COMPOSABLE is reachable with no extra call.
  Pass `gitnexus_dir` to select a store under the MCP **file root** (the
  project root for freshness/`gitnexus analyze`), or `no_composable:
  true` to skip detection/generation and score SIMPLE/SECURE/NAVIGABLE only.
  `gitnexus_dir` does not change the file root — point the server's file
  root at the repo that owns the graph. If GitNexus isn't installed or
  generation fails, `coupling_available` is `false` and any verdict
  containing COMPOSABLE (including 🏆 **PLATINUM**) is unreachable — the
  result includes both top-level `warnings` and a COMPOSABLE-pillar
  `mdg.unavailable` interpretation explaining why.
- Whole project: `topos_evaluate_project` with
  `{"path": "..."}` — same default generation behavior, plus
  a rollup plus page-global lists (`hard_fails`, `leaf_composable_zeros`,
  `maintainability_giants`; `worst_files` is deprecated). Treat
  `aggregate_floor_verdict` as the codebase floor; start from `hard_fails[0]`
  or `guidance`.

### 2. Plan

Read the `guidance` field of the evaluation result. It's priority-aware and
tells you which dimension to work on. If COMPOSABLE is still unreachable
after evaluating (see `warnings`), GitNexus is either not installed or its
generation failed — install it (`npm install -g gitnexus`) or fix the
reported problem, then re-evaluate. `topos_depgraph_status` gives a
read-only diagnosis without triggering generation; `topos_generate_depgraph`
lets you force a refresh explicitly.

For deep analysis of a specific file, call `topos_inspect_code` with either
`{"filepath": "..."}` or `{"code": "..."}` — it
returns top-N functions by complexity, source line, entropy details, and the
full metric table. The `filepath` form takes the same `gitnexus_dir` /
`no_composable` knobs as `topos_evaluate_file` and resolves the dependency
graph the same way, so its verdict matches; the `code` form has no module in
the graph and reaches SIMPLE/SECURE/NAVIGABLE only.

### 3. Propose

Write a refactor. Keep the change focused on one dimension at a time.

**Editing the file in place (recommended for coding agents).** After you edit
the target file directly, you don't need to re-send the source — recover the
baseline automatically:

- `topos_assess_worktree_change` with
  `{"filepath": "...", "baseline_ref": "HEAD"}` — compares the
  working-tree file to its committed version. Stateless; the common "did my
  edit beat HEAD?" check. Point `baseline_ref` at any branch/commit.
- For an untracked/new file, or a baseline that was never committed, snapshot
  it **before** editing: `topos_begin_refactor {"filepath": "..."}`
  → returns `snapshot_id` → edit → `topos_assess_snapshot
  {"snapshot_id": "...", "filepath": "..."}`. A missing/expired
  snapshot reports `blocked_by` `snapshot_not_found` / `snapshot_stale`.

**Side-by-side comparison.** When you have a proposed variant in hand, submit
via `topos_assess_improvement` with
`{"filepath": "...", "proposed_code": "..."}`, or use
`proposed_filepath` when the proposed version is already
written inside the configured file root.

### 4. Verify

All assessment tools return one of:

- `IMPROVEMENT` — lattice moved up (e.g. ❌ SLOP → 🥉 BRONZE, or 🥉 BRONZE → 🥈 SILVER). Topos accepts the structural direction; behavior checks still gate final acceptance.
- `IMPROVEMENT_SCORE` — lattice unchanged but per-dim scores improved.
  Progress, but not a medal jump yet.
- `LATERAL_MOVE` — neither improved nor regressed. Try a different angle.
- `REGRESSION` / `REGRESSION_SCORE` — revert and re-plan.
- **`SUSPICIOUS_NO_STRUCTURAL_CHANGE`** — ⚠️ scores moved but AST barely
  changed. The refactor is probably cosmetic (whitespace / comments /
  renames). Make a structural change, not a textual one. **Do not commit.**

When SECURE fails, file-level evaluation and assessment include
`security_findings` by default.  Start with `callee`, `line`, and `snippet`;
these are the actionable fields an agent needs before guessing at fixes.
If a project `.topos.toml` or an `allow` input acknowledges a finding, the raw
SECURE verdict remains visible as `secure_raw`, the adjusted result is visible
as `secure_adjusted` / `adjusted_lattice_element`, and acknowledged entries are
listed in `acknowledged_risks`. Only active findings drive SECURE suggestions.
Acknowledged risk can never buy an undisclosed top-tier grade.

### 5. Decide

Stop when:
- Verdict = 🏆 **PLATINUM** (all four generators satisfied), OR
- Priority-specific generator satisfied (`simple` → SIMPLE bit set,
  `composable` → COMPOSABLE bit set, `secure` → SECURE bit set,
  `navigable` → NAVIGABLE bit set), OR
- `max_iterations` exhausted — report partial progress honestly rather than
  gaming one more iteration.

Prefer the structured `agent_contract` field over parsing prose. It carries
`next_tool`, `next_actions`, `blocked_by`, `verification_gates`, and
`risk_flags` for the current result.

## Escape hatches — when the loop stalls

### Stall #1: Every generator score plateaus below 60%

Often a sign the file needs to be **split**, not refactored. Use
`topos_inspect_code` to find the top-complexity functions; consider
extracting them into a separate module. Re-run `topos_evaluate_project` to
check the rollup doesn't regress as a result.

### Stall #2: `SUSPICIOUS_NO_STRUCTURAL_CHANGE` repeatedly

You're iterating on presentation. Step back: what is the *structural*
problem? Rename → not a refactor. Whitespace → not a refactor. Loop
unrolling, extracted helpers, collapsed conditionals → real refactors.

### Stall #3: SIMPLE improves, COMPOSABLE regresses

Classic "moved complexity elsewhere" anti-pattern. Re-run
`topos_evaluate_project` — did the other file's score drop? If so, the
refactor didn't reduce total system complexity, it just relocated it.
Consider if the abstraction is actually an improvement or just a shuffle.

## Priority selection cheat sheet

- Leaf module (few callers) → `simple`
- Library surface (many importers) → `composable`
- File handling untrusted input → `secure`
- File agents keep having to read and edit → `navigable`
- Unknown / general cleanup → `secure` (default scorer emphasis)

See `topos://docs/priority` for more.

## Preference-driven targeting

For agent loops that need a concrete *next-best* verdict to aim for —
not just an upweighted generator — pass `preferences` alongside
`priority`. A `preferences.ranking` like `["composable", "secure",
"simple", "navigable"]` (a permutation of all four) induces a total order
on Ω and produces a **two-stage** target:

1. **`target`** — aspirational, default 🏆 **PLATINUM**. Try to beat the
   thresholds for all four generators first.
2. **`fallback_target`** — the **"ideal intersection"**, i.e. the meet
   of the top-two ranked generators (🥈 **SILVER**). When PLATINUM
   plateaus, divert here.

The result also returns a **`walk`** (descending verdicts from PLATINUM
down) and a **`next_step`** (the smallest improvement above the
current verdict). Note the walk's second element concedes only the
lowest-ranked generator; `fallback_target` sits further down, conceding
the bottom two.

Concretely: aim for 🏆 **PLATINUM** for the first few iterations; if the
lattice verdict won't move, switch to `fallback_target` (🥈 **SILVER**) and
try to satisfy only the top-two generators. See `topos://docs/preferences`.

## Advisory refactoring (`topos_refactor`)

Separate from gate-failure `refactor_targets` on evaluate results.
`topos_refactor` is read-only advisory analysis and **does not** feed
SIMPLE / COMPOSABLE / SECURE / NAVIGABLE scoring.

Call with `{"target": "...", "filepath": "...", "limit": 5}`
(optional `gitnexus_dir`; ignored for `target="cycles"`):

| `target` | Engine | Needs GitNexus | What you get |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `cycles` | CFG cycle basis (homology) | No | Source ranges for real loops/branches behind cyclomatic complexity |
| `dependencies` | Balanced Forman curvature on the MDG | Yes (GitNexus) | Dependency edges worth strengthening |
| `process` | Directed Forman-Ricci on process graphs | Yes (GitNexus) | Execution choke-point transitions |

Hotspot fields (intentionally terse for wire size): `kind`, `label`,
`filepath`, `line_start` / `line_end`, `score`, `suggestion`.

Do **not** treat advisory hotspots as medal policy. Use evaluate/assess for
lattice movement; use `topos_refactor` when you want structural hotspot
hints outside the scoring loop.

Repo engineering write-up (filesystem, not an MCP resource):
`docs/decisions/refactor-suite.md`, `openwiki/workflows/agent-and-cli.md`.

## Structural test coverage (`topos_calculate_coverage`)

Static UAST-overlap between a program-under-test and test files — **not**
executed line/branch coverage and **not** proof that tests call production
symbols. Outside the lattice. Engineering reference:
`docs/decisions/structural-test-coverage.md`, `openwiki/workflows/agent-and-cli.md`.

## Repo OpenWiki (filesystem, not `topos_get_doc`)

`topos_get_doc` / `topos://docs/*` only serve the seven embedded topics
(`agent-contract`, `lattice`, `metrics`, `preferences`, `priority`,
`workflows`, `compiled-agent-loop`). Broader engineering docs live under `openwiki/` in the
repository (quickstart, architecture, domain, operations, integrations).
Agents with workspace access should read those files directly; they are
**not** MCP resources.

## Compiled baseline benchmarks

`topos_benchmark` is a separate signal from the lattice. It compiles the C
workloads named in a benchmark manifest, runs each one, and reports measured
wall-clock time, static instruction count, and binary size per workload.

- `manifest_path` — benchmark manifest TOML; defaults to the repo manifest.
- `compare_baseline` — path to a stored baseline JSON. When given, the response
  carries `baseline_violations`: one message per workload whose wall-clock time
  regressed beyond `tolerance_pct`.
- `write_baseline` — write the current run to a baseline JSON for later runs to
  compare against.

It requires `clang` on `PATH` and errors plainly when the toolchain is missing —
it never substitutes an estimate for a measurement. Its numbers are wall-clock
observations on the machine that ran them, not a portable claim, and it does
not feed the SIMPLE/COMPOSABLE/SECURE/NAVIGABLE verdict.

## What Topos does NOT measure

- **Whether tests pass or behavior is preserved.** A refactor can lift the
  lattice score yet break behavior — the evaluate/assess loop cannot see this,
  so run the suite separately. (Test *coverage* itself — structural UAST
  declaration matching and k-gram recall — is available as a distinct signal
  via `topos_calculate_coverage`; it is not part of the lattice verdict.)
- **Functional correctness.** AST edit distance measures *change*, not
  *preservation of behavior*. Verify behavior with relevant project tests or
  equivalent checks when available; if unavailable or not run, report that
  explicitly.
- **Runtime performance.** Orthogonal to all *lattice* metrics — no structural
  score predicts execution speed. Measured separately by `topos_benchmark`,
  whose figures never feed the verdict.
- **Beyond-syntactic security.** The SECURE generator catches obvious
  footguns (dangerous-API call sites, source→sink taint paths) via
  textual / structural pattern matching on the CPG.  It is not a full
  SAST / pen-test — pair with dedicated security tooling for high-stakes
  code.

Topos is one signal in a multi-signal loop. Pair it with test coverage and
type checks for the full picture.
