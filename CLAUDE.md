## Agent Skills

Canonical skill at [`skills/topos/SKILL.md`](skills/topos/SKILL.md) — published to ClawHub and installable via Hermes taps.

| Runtime | Install |
| --- | --- |
| OpenClaw / ClawHub | `openclaw skills install @Krv-Labs/topos` |
| Hermes | `hermes skills tap add Krv-Labs/topos` then `hermes skills install Krv-Labs/topos/topos` |
| Local (dev) | `openclaw skills install ./skills/topos` |

Validate with `python scripts/check_skill.py` (requires each skill's `version:` to match `Cargo.toml`).

**ClawHub publish setup:** add repo secret `CLAWHUB_TOKEN` — create a token at [clawhub.ai](https://clawhub.ai) (`clh_...`), then GitHub → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions. The [ClawHub Skill Publish](.github/workflows/clawhub-publish.yml) workflow dry-runs on PRs and publishes on `main` (`skills/**`) and `v*` tags. Manual fallback: `clawhub skill publish ./skills/topos --owner Krv-Labs`.

## OpenWiki CI (repo-owned policy)

Canonical workflow: [`.github/workflows/openwiki.yml`](.github/workflows/openwiki.yml).

### What it does

Regenerates the engineering wiki under `openwiki/` from the codebase, then opens a docs PR (`openwiki/update`) with only:

- `openwiki/**`
- `AGENTS.md`
- `CLAUDE.md`

Workflow files are **never** committed by that PR.

### When it runs (no cron)

1. **A PR is merged / code is pushed to `main`** on non-docs paths, or
2. **Manual** — Actions → **OpenWiki Update** → **Run workflow**

`paths-ignore` covers `openwiki/**`, `AGENTS.md`, and `CLAUDE.md` so merging the auto-generated docs PR does **not** re-run OpenWiki and burn credits.

### Cost / model

> [!NOTE]
> **OpenAI usage:** This workflow calls OpenAI with `OPENWIKI_MODEL_ID=gpt-5.6-terra` via the repo secret `OPENAI_API_KEY` (already configured). Each run bills the OpenAI account for a full OpenWiki regeneration. Prefer intentional runs—after meaningful code merges or a manual **Run workflow**—and avoid repeated or speculative executions. Pure `openwiki/**` / `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md` merges are ignored so the auto-docs PR does not re-trigger itself. Prefer the generated docs PR over hand-editing OpenWiki pages.

### Hardening against OpenWiki CLI overwrites

OpenWiki CLI rewrites `.github/workflows/openwiki-update.yml` on every `openwiki code --update` (stock daily cron template). CI:

1. Uses **only** `openwiki.yml` as the committed workflow
2. **Deletes** any regenerated `openwiki-update.yml` after the CLI runs
3. **Excludes** `.github/workflows/**` from `create-pull-request` `add-paths`

### MCP docs vs OpenWiki

`topos_get_doc` / `topos://docs/*` serve seven embedded topics (`agent-contract`, `lattice`, `metrics`, `preferences`, `priority`, `workflows`, `compiled-agent-loop`). Broader engineering docs live under `openwiki/` on the filesystem — they are **not** MCP resources. Agents with workspace access should read those files directly.
